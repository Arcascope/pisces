The plot you've provided shows the **skewness** (on the left) and **kurtosis** (on the right) for three different types of data: **Stationary**, **Hybrid**, and **Naive Hybrid** under the context of "WASA97."

Let's break it down:

### **Skewness (Left Plot):**
- **Stationary Data**: This has a skewness value of approximately **-1.1**, indicating a **negatively skewed distribution**. The tail is longer on the left side, implying that more of the data is concentrated on the right side of the distribution with some extreme lower values.
  
- **Hybrid Data**: The skewness here is more pronounced, around **-1.4**. This suggests a stronger **negative skew** than the stationary data. The distribution has even more extreme lower values, with a significant concentration of data on the right.

- **Naive Hybrid Data**: This data has a skewness similar to the stationary data, around **-1.1**. Like the stationary case, it indicates a negative skew, but not as pronounced as the hybrid data.

### **Kurtosis (Right Plot):**
- **Stationary Data**: The kurtosis is below **1.0**, meaning this is a **platykurtic** distribution. It has **thinner tails** and a **flatter peak** compared to a normal distribution, suggesting fewer extreme values.

- **Hybrid Data**: The kurtosis is the highest of the three, close to **2.0**, indicating a **leptokurtic** distribution. This implies that the **Hybrid Data** has **fatter tails and a sharper peak**, meaning a higher likelihood of extreme values (outliers) compared to both the stationary and naive hybrid data.

- **Naive Hybrid Data**: The kurtosis is around **1.5**, which is also **leptokurtic**, but not as extreme as the Hybrid Data. It suggests a moderate amount of tail weight, meaning there are some extreme values but not as many as in the hybrid data.

### **Interpretation:**
- The **Hybrid Data** has the most negative skew, indicating that it has more pronounced lower outliers or extreme negative values. At the same time, it has the highest kurtosis, suggesting it also contains a higher concentration of extreme values overall (both positive and negative).
  
- Both the **Stationary** and **Naive Hybrid Data** are similarly skewed to the left, indicating asymmetry toward lower values. However, they differ in terms of kurtosis: **Stationary Data** has thinner tails and is less prone to extreme values, while **Naive Hybrid** is more likely to contain outliers than stationary data but not as extreme as the Hybrid Data.

### Conclusion:
- **Hybrid Data** is the most extreme, both in terms of skewness and kurtosis, which means it has more asymmetry toward lower values and a greater tendency for extreme values.
- **Stationary Data** is the most "stable" with the least skewness and kurtosis, suggesting it is more evenly distributed with fewer outliers.
- **Naive Hybrid Data** lies between the two in terms of kurtosis but has similar skewness to stationary data, implying moderate asymmetry and tail behavior.

This analysis helps to understand the differences in the distribution shape and tail behavior between the data types, especially in relation to outliers and asymmetry.
