    "This package provides a framework for running machine learning experiments in the sleep classification space. The core of the package is `SleepWakeClassifier` class that formalizes an API for pre-processing raw sensor data into model-specified formats and scoring methods, automated data set and subject/feature discovery based on a light folder structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also included is [an example notebook](analyses/stationary_vs_hybrid.ipynb) showing `pisces` being used for analysis in a forthcoming paper from Arcascope. That studies the potential impact to scoring accuracy that may occur when a sleep classifier is trained on stationary subjects in a sleep study, then is deployed for inference on a Naval vessel with lots of ambient mechanical vibrations which affect the accelerometer recordings essential to many approaches to sleep classification.\n",

    "### Key takeaways for data set discovery:\n",
    "1. The data set is discovered based on the presence of a subdirectory matching the glob expression `cleaned_*`.\n",
    "2. Every subdirectory that matches this pattern is considered a feature; these features are named after the part matching `*`.\n",
    "3. Subjects within a feature are computed per-feature, based on variadic and constant parts of the filenames within each feature directory.\n",
    "    1. It is no problem if some subjects are missing a certain feature. When the feature data for an existing subject, without that feature in their data, is requested, the feature will return `None` for that subject.\n",
    "    2. The naming scheme can vary greatly between features. However, the subject id MUST be the prefix on the filenames. For example, `46343_cleaned_motion.out` and `46343_labeled_sleep.txt` are both for the same subject, `46343`. If instead we named those `final_46343_cleaned_motion.out` and `46343_labeled_sleep.txt` then the subject's data would be broken into two subjects, `46343` and `final_46343`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced features of data set discovery:\n",
    "1. There is no _a-priori_ rule about what features in a data set give the labels and which are model inputs. This allows you to call the label feature whatever you want, or use a mixture of features (psg + ...) as labels for complex models supporting rich outputs.\n",
    "2. You can have other folders inside data set directories that do NOT match `cleaned_*`, and these are totally ignored. This allows you to store other data, like raw data or metadata, in the same directory as the cleaned data.\n",
    "3. You can have other folders whose sub-structure does not match the subject/feature structure, and these are totally ignored."
