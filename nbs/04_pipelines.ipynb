    "> The major task you will launch with `PiSCES` is a _Pipeline_ which combines the task of finding data sets and loading them into memory, configuring train-test splits, training models, and organizing and reporting results. To prevent test distribution statistics from leaking into the training data for each model, we strictly enforce that train-test splitting is done at the **study participant** level.  \n",

    "> Said differently, under no circumstances will a PiSCES pipeline produce a set of training samples that contain data covering 6 hours of an 8 hour recording for Participant ABC123, and the remaining 2 hours is used for test evaluation; giving a model access to recordings from a participant during training skews results in the model's favor on testing, since it is more familiar with ABC123's specific signatures when asleep, awake, and transitioning."
