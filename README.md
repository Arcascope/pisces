# pisces

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This package provides a framework and examples for running machine
learning experiments in sleep classification. Pisces offers automated
data set and subject/feature discovery based on a light folder
structure, loading CSVs into pandas `DataFrame` objects. A number of
tools are also provided for plotting, scoring, and debugging sleep
research pipelines.

## Installation

Start by making a python or conda environment with Python 3.11 and
installing the requirements from file. For example, you can create an
environment called `pisces` by:

``` shell
conda create -n pisces python=3.11
conda activate pisces 
```

In the same terminal (so that your new conda environment is active),
navigate to the directory where you’d like to clone the package and run
the following commands to clone it and use `pip` to install the package
in an editable way with `-e .`

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Arcascope/pisces.git
cd pisces
pip install -e .
```

### Common issues

You may end up with a version of Keras incompatible with the marshalled
data in `pisces/cached_models`. In that case, run
[`pisces_setup`](https://Arcascope.github.io/pisces/deep_unet_support.html#pisces_setup)
in a terminal;
[`pisces_setup`](https://Arcascope.github.io/pisces/deep_unet_support.html#pisces_setup)
is in your path as long as a Python environment with `pisces` installed
is active.

## Usage

The pipeline is intended to be flexible and can be easily extended to
include new models, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In version 2.0, we
have streamlined the library to prioritizing nimbleness and easy
debugging.

The `examples/NHRC` folder shows how to use `pisces` with other packages
like `sklearn` and `tensorflow` providing machine learning frameworks.

## Data Sets

Pisces automatically discovers data sets that match a simple, flexible
format inside a given directory. The analysis in `examples/NHRC/src`
finds data contained in the `data` folder of the Pisces repository. The
code is simple:

``` python
from pisces.data_sets import DataSetObject

sets = DataSetObject.find_data_sets("../data")
walch = sets['walch_et_al']
hybrid = sets['hybrid_motion']
```

Now we have 2
[`DataSetObject`](https://Arcascope.github.io/pisces/data_sets.html#datasetobject)s,
`walch` and `hybrid`, that can be queried for their subjects and
features. These were discovered because these are folders inside of
`data` that have a compatible structure.

These two sets were discovered because of the presence of at least one
subdirectory matching the glob expression `cleaned_*`. Every
subdirectory that matches this pattern is considered a feature, so based
on the example below, Pisces discovers that `hybrid_motion` and
`walch_et_al` both have `psg`, `accelerometer`, and `activity` features,
in addition to other folders they may have not listed.

The `data` directory looks like:

``` sh
data
├── walch_et_al
│   ├── cleaned_accelerometer
│   │   ├── 46343_cleaned_motion.out
│   │   ├── 759667_cleaned_motion.out
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── cleaned_activity
│   │   ├── 46343_cleaned_counts.out
│   │   ├── 759667_cleaned_counts.out
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── cleaned_psg
│   │   ├── 46343_cleaned_psg.out
│   │   ├── 759667_cleaned_psg.out
│   │   ├── ...
├── hybrid_motion
│   ├── cleaned_accelerometer
│   │   ├── 46343.csv
│   │   ├── 759667.csv
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── cleaned_activity
│   │   ├── 46343.csv
│   │   ├── 759667.csv
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── cleaned_psg
│   │   ├── 46343_labeled_sleep.txt
│   │   ├── 759667_labeled_sleep.txt
│   │   ├── ...
```

### Key takeaways for data set discovery:

1.  The data set is discovered based on the presence of a subdirectory
    matching the glob expression `cleaned_*`.
2.  Every subdirectory that matches this pattern is considered a
    feature; these features are named after the part matching `*`.
3.  Subjects within a feature are computed per-feature, based on
    variadic and constant parts of the filenames within each feature
    directory. Said in a less fancy way, because the `walch_et_al`
    accelerometer folders contain the files `46343_cleaned_motion.out`
    and `759667_cleaned_motion.out` which have `_cleaned_motion.out` in
    common, Pisces identifies `46343` and `759667` as subject IDs that
    have accelerometer feature data for `walch_et_al`.
    1.  It is no problem if some subjects are missing a certain feature.
        When the feature data for an existing subject, without that
        feature in their data, is requested, the feature will return
        `None` for that subject.
    2.  The naming scheme can vary greatly between features. However,
        the subject id MUST be the prefix on the filenames. For example,
        `46343_labeled_sleep.txt` are both for the same subject,
        `46343`. If instead we named those
        `final_46343_cleaned_motion.out` and `46343_labeled_sleep.txt`
        then the subject’s data would be broken into two subjects,
        `46343` and `final_46343`.

### Advanced features of data set discovery:

1.  There is no *a-priori* rule about what features in a data set give
    the labels and which are model inputs. This allows you to call the
    label feature whatever you want, or use a mixture of features (psg +
    …) as labels for complex models supporting rich outputs.
2.  You can have other folders inside data set directories that do NOT
    match `cleaned_*`, and these are totally ignored. This allows you to
    store other data, like raw data or metadata, in the same directory
    as the cleaned data.
3.  You can have other folders whose sub-structure does not match the
    subject/feature structure, and these are totally ignored.
